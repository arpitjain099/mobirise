    <div id="1" class="collapse">
FundMyVenture is one of its discovery and deal making platform to help startups raise funds easily and efficiently. We believe that great ideas are brimming in India, but they die an early death due to lack of funds and social validation. Often there is a lot of gap between companies looking forward to raising funds vs interested investors who wish to be a part of innovative business ideas. Our aim is to democratize the way Indian startups raise funds by going directly to the people (thanks to favorable proposals from the #StartupIndia initiative by the Government of India). People support these business proposals not for charity, but in return for equity. If the company you invest in makes it big, you also get a share in their growth story. Music to the ears, isn't it? :)<br>
